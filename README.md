# RED Academy Project 3 - Mars Quiz App

**Project Description**

A single-page application that tests users on Mars-based trivia.

**Tools & Methods Used**

- HTML/CSS
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) (Sass, Webpack, BrowserSync)
- Git & GitHub for Version Control

**Little Things I Learned**

- real world/proper project directory structure by using separate _build_ and _source_ folders
- use of _flex_ to place the header on the site-header
- layering of the _text-shadow_ property to give a faux 3D effect and glowing effect
- the order of the component lifecycle methods
- single-page applications are loaded, in it's entirety, to the client side

**Project Epilogue**

This project was my first go at building a single-page application using the React library. The most important takeaway from this project was that in React most of, if not all, the logic will be done via methods within any given component.

Understanding the inner workings of React was definitely the most challenging aspect of this project. The cyclical nature of React was quite different from vanilla JavaScript and even AngularJS, and was the cause of a lot of logic headaches. In addition, making the distinction be between _states_ and _props_ proved difficult throughout. Over time, it became understood that _states_ are internal to a component and prone to change while _props_ are external, often passed between components, and rarely change.

Overall, using the React library challenged the way I thought about JavaScript logic and how it can be written. Due to its structure, I found it difficult to reason about what was going on in the code. However, after going to the struggles of completing the project, I have found an appreciation for what the React library does differently and I look forward to locking horns with the library in the future.
